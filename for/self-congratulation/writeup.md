# Self-congratulation

Full write-up to come on https://zoug.to

The flag is hidden in our logo. You'll notice a weird black and white symbol on the upper left, which is just the flag encoded in ASCII and displayed as 1s and 0s.

So you just need to code something (or even do it by hand) to get the 1s and 0s back from the symbol, then turn the resulting binary sequence into ascii text.
