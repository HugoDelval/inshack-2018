# Self-congratulation

Original challenge was really to hard to solve so we made a hotfix during the CTF.

The picture was supposed to be the logo inside the ctf website, in the frontpage, but because of the hotfix we give it directly, sorry for people who looked for something during the first hours.

You could notice a small shape with black and white pixels, the point was to traduce this into 0 and 1 and group it by 8. Then it was just converting this groups to ascii characters to get the flag.
