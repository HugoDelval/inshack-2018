# Misc | Visual hashing - hard

We recommend you to have a look at the first part of this chall (Visual hashing - easy) before attempting this one.

Our teams managed to infect a French Bureau of Investigation expert who uses [the same extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/visual-hashing/lkoelcpcjjehbjcchcbddggjmphfaiie), however our spy forgot to click "Remove USB safely" so now the video file is all corrupted.

We managed to save one of the frames from the capture, see what you can do with it. Also, we know that the password has the format INSA{<lowercase>}. Good luck.
