# White House InSecurity - Part 2

The two parts of this challenge are independent, but we recommend doing Part 1 first, which will help you a lot to understand how the White House server works.

We have one more mission for you : retrieve the nuclear master key. We heard only `administrator` is allowed to see them, but there must be a way...

The server is the same as part 1.
