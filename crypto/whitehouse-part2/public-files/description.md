# White House InSecurity - Part 2

The two parts of this challenge are independent, but we recommend doing Part 1 first, which will help you a lot to understand how the White House server works.

We have one more mission for you : retrieve the nuclear master key. We heard only `administrator` is allowed to see them, but there must be a way...

The server is the same as part 1.



There is also a bonus part to this challenge : If you manage to leak the encryption key by any means WITHOUT BREAKING THE CHALL, please report it to an admin and we might award bug bounty points.

I have no idea whether it's possible (spoiler alert : 600 lines of C written at 2am while drunk), but there's an easier way to solve the task anyway.

Enjoy !
