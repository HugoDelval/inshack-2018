# White House InSecurity - Part 3

This is a bonus part for the White House Challenge.

Listen, I was drunk and tired as fuck while making this chall so there is probably a way to leak the encryption key. If you manage to get the key and submit it as `INSA{<key>}` I'd be happy to hear how you did that (it'd be nice to also write a tiny writeup after the CTF ends so others can enjoy it).

I do not guarantee there is a way to get the encryption key in reasonable time, and anything is allowed as long as you don't break the chall for others. Please also note that we reserve the right to remove you the points for this chall if you're not playing by the rules. Take this as a bug bounty more than as a chall. 

We might patch reported vulnerabilities along the way, but we will make sure to notify everyone.

Enjoy !
